##Multiple Linear Regression Model

We built two multilinear regression models, investigating the association between asthma rate and tree density, sulfur dioxide SO2 and poverty level for children from 0 to 4 years old and children from 5 to 14 years old.

model one: asthma = -103.55-450005 tree_density +192SO2+ 11.17poverty

model two: asthma = -82.55 -471392 tree_density+ 122SO2+12.87poverty
