### About the Data

*   Data from [NYC health](http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/PublicTracking.aspx) was used to obtain the rate of asthma emergency department visit in children from 0-4 years old and 5-14 years old,as well as the poverty level and air qualities in each entity in NYC. Based on this dataset we calculate the association between __poverty and asthma rate__ as well as __SO2 and asthma rate__.


*   Data from [NYC open data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/pi5s-9p35) was used to obtain the number of trees in different entities in NYC, based on which we visualized the density of trees in different entities to explore the identical characteristics of __tree density__ and asthma rate distribution.


*   Data of [United Hospital Fund (UHF) Neighborhood](http://www.infoshare.org/misc/UHF.pdf)
